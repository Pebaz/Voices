Create an app that allows you to talk with yourself and store the resulting
conversations in JSON or XML.

You talk by typing into a text box and hitting enter. It automatically switches
to the other person or the next person in line. You can select which person
manually also. This allows multiple people to talk in the same conversation.

The goal of this would be to maintain several large conversations and allow
you to save and load them from disk.
